CPEN311-Embedded-Systems
========================

Several course projects implementing embedded system programming using the HC11 microcontroller

Lab 3: Reads a keypad entry and displays its 15 segment representation on the lights
Lab 6:SPI Serial data transfer to lights from keypad, SPI Serial data transfer from switches to LCD
Lab 7: Utilize the timer operations of the 68HC11 to measure waveforms and create waveforms.  Further utilized a variable voltage source and a low pass filter to create smoother output.
Lab 8: This lab is designed to implement an ohmeter that can determine the value of a
		resistor within 1% of the actual value.  This design implements a digital/analog
		converter, current buffer, and comparator circuit to implement the ohmeter.
Lab 9: This lab is a digital signal analyzer that determines period, frequency and duty cycle.
		It also determines the high, low, and average level of the voltage.
Final Project: This project measures resistance and capacitance by a user placing those components in their respective terminals.
